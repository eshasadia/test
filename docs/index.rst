CORE Documentation
==================

**CORE** – A Cell-Level Coarse-to-Fine Image Registration Engine for Multi-stain Image Alignment.

CORE is a fast and accurate coarse-to-fine image registration engine designed for aligning
multi-stain whole-slide images (WSIs).  It combines prompt-based tissue masking, rapid coarse
alignment, and nuclei-level fine registration to deliver precise cell-level correspondence across
stains.
